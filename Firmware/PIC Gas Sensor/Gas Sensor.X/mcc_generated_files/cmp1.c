  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CMP1 driver using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description
    This source file provides APIs for CMP1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC12F1822
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v2.35 or v3.00
